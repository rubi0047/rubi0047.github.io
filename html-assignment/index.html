            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is <em>Sam</em>, a 30-year-old who loves skiing and movies. I grew up in the Glebe in Downtown Ottawa and spent my teenage years as an internationally ranked ski racer from 17 to 20. Nowadays, you can find me skiing in Quebec at least once a week during the winter time. I’ve always been a huge fan of movies and animation, especially Star Wars. My family and I have enjoyed <abbr title="Star Wars">SW</abbr> films together since I was a kid, watching the whole series at least once a year. Star Wars has been a special part of my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated with a film degree from Carleton University eight years ago, and I still love everything about cinema. I’m also a big Pokémon fan and have a Charizard tattoo on my leg to show it! As for snacks, popcorn is my favourite—it’s a must-have when I’m watching a movie. I am also excited at the prospect of becoming an Algonquin graduate and starting a new career!
            </p>
